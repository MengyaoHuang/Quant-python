# Quant-python

##  introduction
These are programs Iâ€™ve written while learning Python. The implementation is in Jupyter notebooks. This project is a collection of short python programs I wrote during bootcamp.
## python basics
We learned about python datatypes,
if-elif-else conditionals, for and while loops,lists and tuples, and
list comprehensions.

Here is my [basics Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/MengyaoHuang/Quant-python/blob/master/python-basics-notebook.ipynb).
