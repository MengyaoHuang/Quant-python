# Quant-python-Basic

##  introduction
- These are programs Iâ€™ve written while learning Python. The implementation is in Jupyter notebooks. This project is a collection of short python programs I wrote during bootcamp.

## python basics
- We learned about python datatypes, if-elif-else conditionals, for and while loops,lists and tuples, and list comprehensions.
